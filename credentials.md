# Default User Credentials

This file documents the default passwords for newly created users. Since the teacher or a system admin creates user accounts, these initial passwords should be communicated to the users so they can log in for the first time. It is highly recommended that all users change their password upon their first login.

## Roles and Passwords

-   **Teacher:**
    -   Default Password: `teacher123`

-   **Student:**
    -   Default Password: `student123`

-   **Parent:**
    -   Default Password: `parent123`


## Security Note

These are default, insecure passwords intended only for initial setup. In a production environment, you should implement a more secure mechanism, such as:
-   Forcing a password reset on first login.
-   Sending one-time login links via email.
